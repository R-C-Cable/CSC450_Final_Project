# CSC450_Final_Project
Programing III Final Project(Concurrent Programing and Security)

Program description:

This is a simple concurrent program in Java. It simply passes a counter method with a starting and ending integer to the defined thread, MyThread. Then MyThread runs the counter method that validates the parameters, counts from the starting to ending integer, and then it repeats this in the opposite direction.

Just a simple, but effective display of knowledge
