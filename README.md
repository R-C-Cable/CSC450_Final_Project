# CSC450_Final_Project
Programing III Final Project(Concurrent Programing and Security)

Completed: 06/06//2021

Program description:

This is a simple concurrent program in Java. It simply passes a counter method with a starting and ending integer to the defined a thread, MyThread. Then MyThread runs the counter method that validates the parameters, counts from the starting to ending integer, and then it repeats this in the opposite direction.

Just a simple, but effective display of knowledge
